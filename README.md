# AJAX-dogs-api
Exercise from intro to web development v2 , where we use an api to show dogs pictures, using AJAX.

For your extra-credit project, here are some cool ways to expand this project:

Add this to your GitHub in its own repo (we'll learn how to do that later)
Style it nice using CSS.
Show a loading gif (just use an <img />) that shows when you're loading a new doggo and then hide it when you're done.
The dog.ceo API allows you to [request a list of breeds](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/). Use this list to populate a <select></select>. Then when a user select a dog breed, show a picture of that dog using the the [random image by breed API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed).
